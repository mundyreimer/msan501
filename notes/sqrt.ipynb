    "# Approximating square root\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of useful functions that have no closed form solution, meaning we can't just do a computation and return the value. Instead, we need to use an iterative method to approximate the function value. We can use this to approximate sine (with Taylor series expansion), approximate square root (as we'll do in this lecture), or optimize a cost or error function (gradient descent in next lecture).\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the previous uniform random variable lecture, we must translate a recurrence relation to Python.  Instead of returning a single value in the recurrence series, we will look for **convergence of the series**. In other words, if we run the series out far enough, $x_{i+1}$ will be close to $x_i$ leaving $x_i$ as  a very accurate approximation of square root. This will teach us the basics of iterative computing and prepare us for the more complicated function optimization material.\n"
